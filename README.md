This project involves development of Real Time kernel for ARM Cortex M4 based processors. Concurrent execution of processes was achieved using a priority scheduler. In order to avoid race conditions among processes, synchronization primitives like semaphore and mutex were implemented.

**Completed Work**

A Soft RTOS with priority based scheduler has been implemented.
Synchronization primitives like Semaphore, Mutex has been incorporated. 


**Goals for 2019-2020**

1) Conversion of Soft RTOS into Hard RTOS by changing the scheduler to RMS or similar scheduling algorithms
2) Implementing Interprocess Communication methods
3) Develop a robust application which proves the efficiency of execution is higher when running over a kernel than bare metal programming
4)Explore networking options in Spy-RTOS
