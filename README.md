**Abstract**

This project involves development of Real Time kernel for ARM Cortex M4 based processors. Concurrent execution of processes was achieved using a priority scheduler. In order to avoid race conditions among processes, synchronization primitives like semaphore and mutex were implemented. A interactive two player game  has been implemented to show the multi-tasking and resource sharing ablility of the Real Time Operating System. 

**Completed Work**

* A Hard RTOS with pre-emptive priority based scheduler has been implemented.
* The scheduling algorithm has O(1) time complexity.
* Synchronization primitives like Semaphore, Mutex has been incorporated. 
* Bulit a Ping Pong Game in Nokia 5110 LCD to show multi-tasking efficiency.
